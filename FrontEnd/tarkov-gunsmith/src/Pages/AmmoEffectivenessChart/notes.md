# Notes

Idea: Let's bring back the AEC, as we know that the soft body armor layers can be modelled by the mean or the median.

Comment: From checking the min-avg-max of stats with aramid/durability/blunt, we know that the difference is miniscule in results, and we can just use the average.

So we're going to be comparing how effective bullets are to plates and non-plate armors.

So we will need:

- Vests
- Rigs
- Helmets
- Face covers
- Plates

Ammo vs Combination

Combination can be:

- Thorax
  - Vest/Rig
  - Plate
  - Vest/Rig + Plate
- Head
  - Helmet
  - Helmet + Plate
  - Face cover(s) (Glasses, Masks, face shields, etc.)
