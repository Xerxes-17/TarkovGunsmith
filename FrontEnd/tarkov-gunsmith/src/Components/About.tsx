                        <h4>FrontEnd</h4>
                        <p>
                            The frontend of this website was made using functional React, TypeScript and <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React-Bootstrap</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are no accounts,
                            as I don't wish to know or track anything about you, aside from it not being needed. I might add user preference cookies for things like saving builds, filters and etc later.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Backend</h4>
                        <p>
                            The backend of this website is a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-minimal-api/">C# minimal API</a>  utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/RatScanner/RatStash">RatStash library</a> created by Moritz.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On that note he has been very helpful and responsive to any update requests and this project would've taken a lot more time if he hadn't made RatStash, so big props to him!
                        </p>
                        <h4>Orchestration</h4>
                        <p>
                            At the moment it's just click-ops onto AWS from a local build, but hopefully soon it'll be a proper CI/CD pipeline. ðŸ˜…
