                            Hilarious, the last time I updated this blog part was on the 14th, 9 months ago. Anyway, new patch, new year, new bugs and issues for the site!<br /><br />

                            Sorry that it took me a while to get the site up and running again, but IRL was eating up a lot of my time and the new armor plate system has a lot of issues and I got a bit fixated on trying to work them out instead of get TG up and running again.<br /><br />

                            You may notice that a few parts of the site are now disabled. This is intentional while I update them, but that could be a while. In particular the new armor system is rather buggy in my opinion, and I don't see much point in working out a simulation on a system with "mistakes" especially when those mistakes will be a pain to mimic and eventually will be patched out.<br /><br />

                            Hop on the discord if you have any questions or suggestions, or would like to see me work my way through things. <br /><br />

                            Sorry about the outage over the past week or so, the elastic beanstalk environment broke and some "fix up later" issues came home to roost right when I had less time available for this.<br /><br />

                            However, it's now been fixed and I've also now got a fully operational death st-, ahem, CI/CD pipeline, and not a janky one like I had before. So now changes and fixes can be developed and applied much faster.<br /><br />

                            Huge thanks to RatherLogical for providing the base code for some ballistics calculations. From this I made a simplified/sanitized version of it for getting the speed of a bullet at a given distance. As such, we now can account for range in our simulations!<br /><br />

                            With this addition, I am confident in being able to say that the Ammo Effectiveness Chart of this website is the new gold-standard for this topic.<br /><br />

                            We can now simulate all of the ammo and armor in the game ðŸ¥³. On top of this the armor damage calculation has been improved.<br /><br />

                            STK has been renamed to HTK as it's a better name, and I've set it to round rather than floor on a fractional number, DAM is now DMG, enabled advanced filtering on the AEC and a few other small interface changes.<br /><br />

                            The ammo effectiveness chart has been given a set of improvements, and has been moved to a STK format rather than using categories. Feedback and reflection made me realize that I was just hiding
                            the relevant number for no real reason. I've also added conditional formatting to a bunch of columns so that a sense of how good or bad a stat is relative to all others in the column can be gained.
                            THe prompt and instructions at the top have also been made a hello f a lot better.<br /><br />

                            In the background I've also fixed up the CI/CD to the level where deploys are much easier now, so going forward I should be making a lot of smaller and more frequent updates.<br /><br />

                            The ammo effectiveness chart is now finished, and looking great! When designing it I decided to go with "hits to kill" as my scale because I think the current and common view of
                            by pure penetration doesn't present the whole picture on how effective a given round is. For instance, some high penetration rounds won't even kill on head shots due to armor damage mitigation.
                            But with my chart, this is accounted for. The scale also shows how rounds perform against the thorax or head, as these numbers can differ significantly.<br /><br />

                            As a part of this table and the other ones I've added, I've had to expand and update the functionality of the Armor Damage Calculator to be beyond its initial scope, so now I've changed the name to
                            "Terminal Ballistics Simulator". Since this function now encompasses both armor and character damage as a focus, I think this name better reflects its new capabilities. I still gotta update the custom mode though.<br /><br />

                            I've now added two data tables which will provide an easy way of looking at how effective a given armor item or ammo projectile is.<br /><br />

                            The idea behind these tables is that the key criteria of effectiveness is shots to kill. So if you put on an armor vest, you want to know how many
                            bullets it will protect you from of each type. While if you are going to use a bullet for your weapon, how many shots it will take to kill someone using a given vest.<br /><br />

                            These tables can be made full-screen and some columns start out hidden, which you can change, in addition to being filterable and sortable. I will probably add more features as
                            I learn more about Material React Table.<br /><br />

                            First up, the MWB now has a "power curves" window displayed under a build. This will allow a user too see
                            where they are relatively speaking with a given build, and can give a sense for how developed a build is
                            at a given level. <br /><br />

                            Second, I've now added "Data Sheets" which can now display the properties of Ammo, Armor and Weapons.
                            It uses Material React Table, which allows for advanced features like grouping, filtering, moving columns, etc. <br /><br />

                            Third, "Enhanced Logic" for the MWB has been expanded to cover the edge cases of Kalashnikovs, G36, SA-58, HK416A5, AUG A1/3.  <br /><br />

                            Fourth, Probably a bunch of smaller backend changes I can't remember.

                            Huge thanks to fellow goon Night Shade for contributing the function to make it possible.
                            With this addition, it is probably high time to get to work on the comparison charts and graphs page. <br /><br />

                            I've also added download and copy to clipboard buttons to the ADC to make sharing easier.

                            A little quicker this time, but the ADC is much simpler to work on.<br /><br />

                            I've now added Rate of Fire as a purely front-end aspect to the ADC, so now you can
                            compare the, a SCAR-L (650rpm) vs the HK-416 (850rpm) without needing to submit
                            for a new calc.<br /><br />

                            Additionally, I've now added in the expected blunt, penetration, average damage and remaining
                            hit points columns to the calculation series. From this you can now of course work out rough
                            shots to kill (STK) and time to kill (TTK) results for thorax or head shots! I would like to also add in a binomial probability column,
                            but I am in fact bad @ math so I haven't been able to implement it yet. If anyone would like to
                            help me out with that, I'd greatly appreciate it! ðŸ˜€ <br /> <br />

                            This new feature is also hugely important because now we have the ability to start charting out
                            how effective a given round should be vs all of the armors in a set of options, in a similar way to
                            nofoodaftermidnight's chart. However it will be better as he gives a rough average for a given class,
                            which has the problem of not accounting for the variation in effective durability. For example
                            a 7.62x39 PS round has a STK of 5 vs a Korund, which isn't too bad, but against a Redut-T5, this becomes
                            an STK of 10, which isn't so great. But anyway, charts coming soon!â„¢<br /> <br />

                            With that done, it's time for a big code-cleanup pass before I add any more features.

                            Damn, almost a week since the last update, and that's been for a good reason; I've been
                            going over the backend code for how weapons are built, first to fix the recent change to
                            the dev-tarkov API and then to improve the accuracy and validity of the builder.<br /><br />

                            I've fixed presets issue and as to the fitting algorithm,  I've broken down an decided upon a mixed approach, where for weapons
                            where a simple logic can work will use that, and for troublesome edge cases they will get specific
                            and enhanced logic to deal with them. And example of this is the upper receiver, barrel, gas block,
                            muzzle device and hand guard selection problem for AR-15 type weapons.<br /><br />

                            The problem here was that the conflicting items data is spread out, and that simply
                            selecting for the immediate best option doesn't always give the best total result in the end
                            due to the loss of later attachments which would've put the 2nd choice in that slot ahead,
                            as it can use the lost attachment(s). The way I've gotten around this was to sit down and
                            think through the combination process and simply brute-force through all of the permutations
                            for this area. I had wanted to try and stick to using common rules for all, but this is
                            easier to develop and perhaps, ultimately more maintainable. Funnily enough, this had been
                            my idea when I started working on this about a year ago, but the lack of deep cloning in the
                            RatStash library at the time scuppered this.<br /><br />

                            I'll also be able to apply this approach to other problem areas soon, such as the hand
                            guard/dust cover problem for AKs, the combo pistol grip and stock options for AKs and ARs
                            and so on. For most other weapons, they have simple modding possibilities, so the less
                            complex selection method should be fine. As an aside, I've added a simple validity of
                            build check, so the user should be notified if something has bugged out and they are given
                            a build that isn't possible.<br /><br />

                            But first, I'm going to improve the front end first, and add some extra features to the ADC.

                            While checking over some build results with the MWB, I found out that things weren't
                            working correctly with M4-pattern weapons due to an assumption of mine being incorrect.
                            In my logic, the assumption is that adding on any modification will lead to improvement
                            of the stats. This does hold true for most weapons, but for the M4-pattern guns, they
                            have a very high base ergo that is then taken away from by the gun barrel. So at the
                            moment, when you are in ergonomics mode, the program correctly chooses to not attach a
                            barrel, as it reduces the total ergonomics. <br /><br />

                            What's more, the flag for something being
                            required is set on the slot, not the mod, and the way I process the filtering of blocking
                            mods is mod-centric and doesn't account for the slots. For now I've disabled the ergonomics
                            priority while I work on solving the issue. Recoil modes still work fine however, and I'm
                            also happy to release the "Meta Recoil" mode where the best recoil modifier is selected
                            for in a slot. Then from the remaining options at this max value, the best ergonomics value
                            is found and filtered and lastly they are sorted to have the lowest price,
                            which is then chosen. Check it out!<br /><br />

                            Another issue you might have noticed recently was the loss of a bunch of options from the
                            selection menus, this was due to a change in the tarkov-dev API in the way that default
                            weapon presets were named and ID'd. This has now been fixed. <br /><br />

                            I've also made a bunch of small UI/UX improvements. An example of this was to change the
                            build/calculate buttons to a more eye-catching green, and adding indicator buttons to the
                            level select in the MWB which shows what loyalty level a trader will be at the current player
                            level.

                                    Another area of somewhat arcane knowledge for the player base is
                                    how armor and characters take damage on hits from various bullets. After much testing
                                    it has now been worked out and it can be easily looked up on this page.

                                    You can currently search by Armor name, Bullet name and set the starting

                                    the result.

                                    There are three data tables, the first is my take on an ammo effectiveness chart, and the other are Ammo vs Armor and Armor vs Ammo. <br />
                                    Eg: With Ammo vs Armor, you will see how that bullet fares against all armor items. With Armor vs Ammo, you will see how a given armor will perform against a selected range of rounds.
